# Project Viva New York
## Recommender Simulation for Mexican Restaurants

## Business Problem

The United States of America is well known for its large Mexican population along the states that compound the American border. However, this analysis takes place far away from the border reaching Canadian lands. As we move up north, native Spanish speakers (Mexican) population decreases and alongside with it, their cultural background. Mexico is well known for its famous and delicious cuisine. The gastronomy is the ensemble of culinary dishes and techniques from Mexico that takes part in traditions and Mexicans daily life, enriched by its country regions, which in turn are a mix of pre-Hispanic Mexico and European cuisine.
Being New York City one of the largest cities in the United States and in the world, known as a great land of opportunities, makes it a perfect place for a venue idea such as a Mexican restaurant. Even due to its large, populated boroughs such as Manhattan that could create a positive impact on sales, costs can be extremely high especially around downtown and its surrounding areas. Bringing to topic multiculturalism, ethnicity plays a vital role into selecting which type of venue will be a good fit and New York City is not an exception. 

New York City Boroughs:
1.	Manhattan
2.	Bronx
3.	Brooklyn
4.	Queens
5.	Staten Island


## Data Overview

The main purpose of this project is to analyze neighborhoods that compound all 5 boroughs from the city of New York and conclude through a series of analyses which areas will be considered, taking into account a series of analyses, the locations that will best fit the conditions for a Mexican restaurant.

The data used on this project is based alone on New York City. Through Foursquare, data such as venues, venues categories and coordinates will be used alongside neighborhoods latitudes and longitudes coordinates to create a merged dataset that will allow the audience to comprehend throughout geospatial data the geography of New York City, population density, and number of local venues in each neighborhood and borough. Machine learning clustering analyses allows to create data visualization of the city neighborhoods and venues dataset and to conclude which areas could be an excellent fit for a Mexican restaurant based on venues frequency and population.
